a friendly, data-driven iteration on the product timeline plot from this [tweet](https://twitter.com/mpesce/status/798320213817061376)

this iteration uses actual `log units shipped` data for the `y-height` of the bars and actual `linear time` data for the `x-position` of the bars

click and drag any of the images or text annotations to change their position and experiment with a new annotation layout

click the background to see axis lines and ticks

for the curious, there is a detailed [commit history](https://github.com/micahstubbs/vr-renaissance/commits/master) at the [vr-renaissance](https://github.com/micahstubbs/vr-renaissance) companion repo

compare this with the [VR Renaissance - Linear Scale](https://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/fa129089b7989975e96b166077f74de4) iteration
